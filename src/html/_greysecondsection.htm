			Our Mission

		<h2 class="text_heading red">Preserve & Fulfil</h2>
		<p class="red">The great reformers come not to destroy the old law, but to fulfil it. Valmiki, Vyas, Plato, Jesus,
			Mohammed,
			Confucius,
			and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu assert the fact either expressly or by their conduct. Our high mission is to convey
			the Divine
			Message to all living beings in a fitting manner. Our object is emphatically not to create rupture but to bring
			about
			harmony. The Gaudiya Math does not seek to destroy all worldly efforts, but rather to redirect them towards
			Krishnaâ€”the
			sweet embodiment of the Absolute Truth.
