				<p class="red text-common">The great reformers come not to destroy the old law, but to fulfil it.
					Valmiki,
					Vyas, Plato,
					Jesus,
					Mohammed,
					Confucius,
					and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu assert the fact either expressly or by their conduct. Our high mission is
					to
					convey
					the Divine
					Message to all living beings in a fitting manner. Our object is emphatically not to create rupture
					but to
					bring
					about
					harmony. The Gaudiya Math does not seek to destroy all worldly efforts, but rather to redirect them
					towards
					Krishna—the
					sweet embodiment of the Absolute Truth.

					Our teachers embody the essence of compassion by offering knowledge—the most profound gift. While

					fulfills immediate needs, sharing the knowledge of how to create sustenance is a greater kindness.
					Gaudiya Math takes
					this even further by imparting the highest knowledge of eternity, making it the pinnacle of
					compassion
					and genuine
					charity. Join us in spreading this transformative compassion!

					This

					In this world, no matter our wealth, we all face threefold miseries: those from our minds
