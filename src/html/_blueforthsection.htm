			Though worshiping Sri Krishna appears religious, it transcends conventional beliefs, as it forgoes both fear
			and the
			pursuit of bhukti (enjoyment) and mukti (salvation). Vaishnava-dharma or jiva-dharma embodies the soul's
			eternal bond
			with Krishna, founded on beauty and compassion. Here, you can explore this profound spiritual path and deepen
			your
			understanding of the timeless connection between the soul and Krishna.
